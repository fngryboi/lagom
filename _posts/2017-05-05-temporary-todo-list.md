*This is not the blog post you are looking for...*

  1. Fix profile picture and favicon
  2. Add social buttons/features for those that aren't in place currently, namely Twitch.tv and Youtube.
  3. Use FontAwesome font directly instead of a CDN
  4. Add a setting for toggling Twitch.tv channel player embedding with my Smart Embed Twitch.tv Player.
